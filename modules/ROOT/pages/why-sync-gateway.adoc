= Why Sync Gateway?

Couchbase brings the power of NoSQL to mobile.
To do so, it is comprises of three different components: xref:couchbase-lite::index.adoc[Couchbase Lite], an embedded NoSQL database to easily include offline capabilities in your app, Sync Gateway, an internet-facing synchronization mechanism that securely syncs data between device and cloud, and xref:server:introduction:intro.adoc[Couchbase Server], a highly scalable and performant NoSQL database in the cloud.

As shown on the diagram below, Sync Gateway is the web tier that exposes a database API for Couchbase Lite databases to replicate to and from Couchbase Server (data is not persisted in Sync Gateway).

Sync Gateway is specialized to provide data synchronization for large-scale interactive web, mobile, and IoT applications.
Common requirements that Sync Gateway was designed to satisfy include:

* User authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can connect to Sync Gateway (see xref:authentication.adoc[user authentication guide]).
* Access Control, guaranteeing that only relevant documents are synced.
Sync Gateway accomplishes this by examining document and applying business logic to decide whether to assign the documents to channels.
Access control and ensuring that only relevant documents are synced are achieved through the use of channels and the xref:sync-function-api.adoc[Sync Function].
